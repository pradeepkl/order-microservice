## Introduction

This integration uses Workload Identity Federation, which is Google Cloud's recommended approach for authenticating workloads outside GCP without using service account keys. This method is more secure because:

- No long-lived credentials are stored in GitHub
- Authentication is temporary and tied to specific workflows
- Access can be limited to specific repositories and actions
- Permissions are granular and follow the principle of least privilege

## Prerequisites

- A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account with billing enabled
- A GitHub repository with the code for your containerized application
- A Dockerfile in your repository's root directory
- Admin permissions on your GitHub repository
- Editor or Admin permissions on your GCP project

## Google Cloud Configuration Steps

### Setting Up Workload Identity Pool

1. **Open the Google Cloud Console**: Go to [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

2. **Navigate to Workload Identity Pools**:
   - Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Workload Identity Pools" in the left navigation menu

3. **Create a New Pool**:
   - Click the "CREATE POOL" button
   - Enter a Pool ID (e.g., `github-pool-new`)
   - Add a display name (e.g., "GitHub Actions Pool")
   - Optionally add a description
   - Click "CONTINUE"
   - For the pool state, select "Enabled"
   - Click "CREATE"

### Creating a Workload Identity Provider

1. **Access the Pool**:
   - Click on the newly created pool name (e.g., "github-pool-new")

2. **Add a Provider**:
   - Click "ADD PROVIDER"
   - Provider ID: `github-provider`
   - Display name: "GitHub Actions Provider"
   - Issuer URL: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
   - Click "CONTINUE"

3. **Configure Attribute Mappings**:
   - Add the following mappings by clicking "ADD MAPPING" for each:
     - `google.subject = assertion.sub`
     - `attribute.actor = assertion.actor`
     - `attribute.repository = assertion.repository`
   - Click "CONTINUE"

4. **Set Attribute Condition**:
   - Add the condition that restricts authentication to your specific repository:
   ```
   assertion.repository == "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME"
   ```
   - Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub repository name (e.g., `pradeepkl/order-microservice`)
   - Click "SAVE"

### Creating a Service Account

1. **Navigate to Service Accounts**:
   - Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts" in the left navigation menu

2. **Create a Service Account**:
   - Click "CREATE SERVICE ACCOUNT"
   - Name: `github-actions`
   - Description: "Service account for GitHub Actions"
   - Click "CREATE AND CONTINUE"
   - Skip the "Grant this service account access to project" section for now
   - Click "DONE"

### Setting Up Permissions

1. **Grant Artifact Registry Access**:
   - Go to "IAM & Admin" > "IAM"
   - Click "GRANT ACCESS"
   - In the "New principals" field, enter your service account email:
     ```
     github-actions@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
     ```
   - Select the role "Artifact Registry Writer"
   - Click "SAVE"

2. **Allow Workload Identity Federation to Impersonate the Service Account**:
   - Go to "IAM & Admin" > "Service Accounts"
   - Click on your service account
   - Go to the "PERMISSIONS" tab
   - Click "GRANT ACCESS"
   - In the "New principals" field, enter:
     ```
     principalSet://iam.googleapis.com/projects/YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool-new/attribute.repository/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME
     ```
   - Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER` with your actual GCP project number
   - Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your GitHub repository name
   - Select the role "Workload Identity User"
   - Click "SAVE"

### Creating Artifact Registry Repository

1. **Navigate to Artifact Registry**:
   - Go to "Artifact Registry" > "Repositories" in the left navigation menu

2. **Create a Repository**:
   - Click "CREATE REPOSITORY"
   - Name: Enter a name for your repository (e.g., `order-microservice-repo`)
   - Format: Select "Docker"
   - Location type: Select "Region"
   - Region: Choose a region (e.g., `asia-south1`)
   - Click "CREATE"

3. **Enable Required APIs**:
   - Go to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for and enable these APIs:
     - Artifact Registry API
     - IAM Credentials API
     - Cloud Resource Manager API
     - Security Token Service API

## GitHub Workflow Configuration

Create a new file in your repository at `.github/workflows/build-push-gcp.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Build and Push to GCP
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "master" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "master" ]
env:
  PROJECT_ID: YOUR_PROJECT_ID
  GAR_LOCATION: YOUR_REGION
  REPOSITORY: YOUR_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPO_NAME
  IMAGE_NAME: YOUR_IMAGE_NAME
 
permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write
jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
    - name: Google Auth
      id: auth
      uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
      with:
        workload_identity_provider: 'projects/YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/github-pool-new/providers/github-provider'
        service_account: 'github-actions@YOUR_PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com'
        token_format: 'access_token'
        
    - name: Docker Auth
      uses: 'docker/login-action@v3'
      with:
        registry: '${{ env.GAR_LOCATION }}-docker.pkg.dev'
        username: 'oauth2accesstoken'
        password: '${{ steps.auth.outputs.access_token }}'
        
    - name: Build and Push Container
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
      with:
        context: .
        push: true
        tags: |
          ${{ env.GAR_LOCATION }}-docker.pkg.dev/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/${{ env.REPOSITORY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:${{ github.sha }}
          ${{ env.GAR_LOCATION }}-docker.pkg.dev/${{ env.PROJECT_ID }}/${{ env.REPOSITORY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}:latest
```

Replace the following placeholders with your actual values:
- `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`: Your GCP project ID
- `YOUR_PROJECT_NUMBER`: Your GCP project number
- `YOUR_REGION`: Your Artifact Registry region (e.g., `asia-south1`)
- `YOUR_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPO_NAME`: The name of your Artifact Registry repository
- `YOUR_IMAGE_NAME`: The name for your Docker image
- `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME`: Your GitHub repository name

## Explanation of GitHub Workflow

Let's break down the GitHub workflow file:

1. **Trigger Configuration**:
   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ "master" ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ "master" ]
   ```
   This section defines when the workflow will run - on pushes and pull requests to the master branch.

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```yaml
   env:
     PROJECT_ID: YOUR_PROJECT_ID
     GAR_LOCATION: YOUR_REGION
     REPOSITORY: YOUR_ARTIFACT_REGISTRY_REPO_NAME
     IMAGE_NAME: YOUR_IMAGE_NAME
   ```
   These variables are used throughout the workflow to avoid repetition and make the workflow more maintainable.

3. **Permissions**:
   ```yaml
   permissions:
     contents: read
     id-token: write
   ```
   This is crucial for Workload Identity Federation. The `id-token: write` permission allows the workflow to request an OIDC token from GitHub, which is exchanged for GCP credentials.

4. **Checkout Step**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Checkout repository
     uses: actions/checkout@v4
   ```
   This step checks out your repository code so it's available to the workflow.

5. **Google Authentication**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Google Auth
     id: auth
     uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2
     with:
       workload_identity_provider: '...'
       service_account: '...'
       token_format: 'access_token'
   ```
   This step authenticates with Google Cloud using Workload Identity Federation. It exchanges the GitHub OIDC token for a Google Cloud access token.

6. **Docker Authentication**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Docker Auth
     uses: 'docker/login-action@v3'
     with:
       registry: '${{ env.GAR_LOCATION }}-docker.pkg.dev'
       username: 'oauth2accesstoken'
       password: '${{ steps.auth.outputs.access_token }}'
   ```
   This step uses the access token from the previous step to authenticate with the Artifact Registry Docker repository.

7. **Build and Push Container**:
   ```yaml
   - name: Build and Push Container
     uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
     with:
       context: .
       push: true
       tags: |
         ...
   ```
   This step builds your Docker image from the Dockerfile in your repository and pushes it to Artifact Registry with two tags: the commit SHA and 'latest'.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Identity Pool does not exist" Error**:
   - Verify the correct project number is used in the workflow file
   - Check if the pool was created in the correct project
   - Ensure the pool name matches exactly (case sensitive)

2. **Authentication Failure**:
   - Wait 5-10 minutes after setting up Workload Identity Federation (permissions can take time to propagate)
   - Verify the attribute condition correctly references your repository
   - Check that the service account has the necessary permissions

3. **Docker Push Failure**:
   - Ensure the Artifact Registry repository exists
   - Verify the region is correct
   - Check that the service account has Artifact Registry Writer permissions

4. **API Not Enabled Error**:
   - Enable all required APIs listed in the prerequisites

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use Restrictive Attribute Conditions**:
   - Limit authentication to specific repositories
   - Consider restricting to specific branches for production deployments

2. **Follow Principle of Least Privilege**:
   - Grant only the necessary permissions to your service account
   - Use different service accounts for different purposes

3. **Use a Dedicated Project for Identity Pools**:
   - Maintain pools in a separate project for better security isolation
   - Apply organizational policies to restrict pool creation

4. **Regularly Audit Permissions**:
   - Periodically review who can authenticate and what they can access
   - Remove permissions that are no longer needed

5. **Enable Audit Logging**:
   - Track who is authenticating and what resources they're accessing
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

By following this guide, you have established a secure, modern CI/CD pipeline that follows Google Cloud's recommended best practices for authentication and authorization.
